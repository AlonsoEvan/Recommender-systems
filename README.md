Recommender systems for MovieLens




Two MovieLens datasets are used here. (link : https://www.kaggle.com/rounakbanik/the-movies-dataset/data)

* **The Full Dataset:** Consists of 26,000,000 ratings and 750,000 tag applications applied to 45,000 movies by 270,000 users. Includes tag genome data with 12 million relevance scores across 1,100 tags.
* **The Small Dataset:** Comprises of 100,000 ratings and 1,300 tag applications applied to 9,000 movies by 700 users.

We will build our Simple Recommender using movies from the *Full Dataset* whereas all personalized recommender systems will make use of the small dataset (due to the computing power I possess being very limited).
